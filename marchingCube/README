1) Using given signed distance to recover a 2D/3D shape;
2) Generating a random point, using Bilinear/Trilinear to determine the position of this point(inside or outside of the shape);
3) Using gradient descent to move the point to the boundary.

Operation:
d: change dimension
s: change shape
p: change random point
